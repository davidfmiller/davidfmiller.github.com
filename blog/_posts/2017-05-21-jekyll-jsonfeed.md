# Jekyll & JSON Feed

READMEANSBLOG has hopped on the [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) train:  [/blog/feed.json](https://readmeansrun.com/blog/feed.json). [Safari](https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/) users with the [READMEANSAFARI](https://readmeansrun.com/code/readmeansafari/) extension installed will be treated quite nicely when viewing the feed in their browser.

View the [diff](https://github.com/davidfmiller/davidfmiller.github.com/commit/b57a7cadd026b28cab18ec9e910f1fd5877895d1) to find out how [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is doing the heavy-lifting.
