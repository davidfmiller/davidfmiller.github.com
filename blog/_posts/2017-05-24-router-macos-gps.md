# Router - a GPS route viewer for your Mac

As an avid cyclist for several years I’ve amassed a pile of `.FIT` files on my computer that have been created & saved from my [Garmin](http://www.garmin.com) GPS dingus. As a reasonably competitive person I signed up for a [Strava](https://www.strava.com) account years ago, but I’ve never had a good way of viewing the GPS routes on my computer… until now:

Behold: [Router](/router/), an application for viewing `.GPX`, `.TCX`, `.KML`, Garmin `.FIT`, and [Pioneer](http://pioneer-cyclesports.com/) `.DB` routes on your Mac. The app is still early on in its evolution, but I figured there’s enough substance to release it into the wild.
