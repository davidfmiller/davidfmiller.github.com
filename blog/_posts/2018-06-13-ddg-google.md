# These are not the Results You're Searching For

Quite some time ago I made a conscious effort to begin using alternative services to [Google](https://www.google.com/) after becoming concerned with their questionable approach to privacy and just general level of all-around creepiness. The first (and easiest) step I made was switching my browsersâ€™ default search engines to the privacy-minded [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). And while DuckDuckGoâ€™s search results are _usually_ good enough, there are times when the search results it provides can be underwhelming. Itâ€™s only when stumbling across these lacklustre search results that I will begrudgingly call upon the internet overlord to serve my searching needs.

After getting tired of manually copying search terms from one browser tab & pasting to another (after navigating and waiting initial page load), I created a following bookmarklet to jump from DuckDuckGo search results to Googleâ€™s results with the click of a button (or a couple taps, if you're on your phone).

Add the following link to your browser favourites:  <a href="javascript:(function()%7B if (document.location.host != 'duckduckgo.com')%7B alert('ðŸš« ðŸ¦† '); return; %7D var input = document.querySelector('input[name=q]'); window.location='https://www.google.com/search?q='+encodeURIComponent(input ? input.value : '');%7D());" onclick="alert('Drag this link to your bookmarks bar'); return false">ddg â†’ google</a>.

â€¦ or use the following bookmarklet if youâ€™d prefer to use [Bing](https://www.bing.com) as your fallback search engine: <a href="javascript:(function()%7B if (document.location.host != 'duckduckgo.com')%7B alert('ðŸš« ðŸ¦† '); return; %7D var input = document.querySelector('input[name=q]'); window.location='https://www.bing.com/search?q='+encodeURIComponent(input ? input.value : '');%7D());" onclick="alert('Drag this link to your bookmarks bar'); return false">ddg â†’ bing</a>.
