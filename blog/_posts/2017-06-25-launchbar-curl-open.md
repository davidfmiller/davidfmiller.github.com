# Curl & Open a URL with LaunchBar

As a long-time fan of [Objective Development](https://www.obdev.at)’s excellent [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/) application utility, I’ve built a handful of actions over the years that have grown to become indispensable. The newest action is [Curl & Open](http://davidfmiller.github.io/lbactions/#curl-open), which downloads the contents of a URL to a temporary file & opens the file in its default application (say, [Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) for a JPG image, or [Router](https://readmeansrun.com/router/) for a GPX file) while allowing your hands to  remain on your keyboard.

View [Curl & Open](https://github.com/davidfmiller/lbactions/blob/master/Curl%20%26%20Open.lbaction/Contents/Scripts/default.swift) — and my other homegrown LaunchBar actions — on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidfmiller/lbactions/).
