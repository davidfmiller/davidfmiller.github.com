# Ubuntu Boostrap

I finally moved the [mainframe](https://readmeansrun.com) & some other projects to [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) machines at [Linode](https://www.linode.com), a provider of cloud-hosting and a sponsor-of-podcasts-extraordinaire.

Linde provides comprehensive [documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/) for getting up & running on their (virtual) hardware, but given that I would be going through this rigamarole a few times in the near future I figured it was best to have a relatively methodical approach… BEHOLD!

(The script probably contains a few things that you won't need — [PHP](https://secure.php.net) _and_ [Node](https://nodejs.org/) — so please don’t copy & paste blindly.)

<!--
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
