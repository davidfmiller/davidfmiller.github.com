# Close All Other Documents in BBEdit's Window

A simple [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html) to close all other documents (ie: not the *active* document) in the current [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) window:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/davidfmiller/b152db1e5e3b0e4f1e87d048cb9f138b.js"></script>

Copy, paste, & save it as a file in `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts`.
